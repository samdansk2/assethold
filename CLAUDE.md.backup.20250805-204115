# AssetHold Development Guide

## Project Overview

AssetHold is a financial analysis platform that helps individual investors track and analyze stock trends for better investment decisions. The system uses a modular architecture with Python and Poetry for dependency management.

## Development Standards

### Python Standards
- Follow PEP 8 coding standards
- Use type hints where applicable
- Implement comprehensive docstrings for public methods
- Use Black for code formatting and isort for import organization

### Modular Architecture
- Maintain clear separation between modules (stocks, portfolio, real estate)
- Use the router pattern for module delegation
- Keep common utilities in the `common/` directory
- Preserve modular boundaries to enable independent testing

### Data Handling Standards
- Use YAML for configuration files and test specifications
- Store data in CSV/JSON formats for simplicity and version control
- Implement proper error handling for data access operations
- Validate data integrity before processing

### Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for all new modules
- Use YAML-based test fixtures for consistency
- Include integration tests for end-to-end analysis workflows
- Validate analysis results against expected outputs

## File Organization

```
src/assethold/
├── engine.py              # Main entry point with router
├── modules/
│   ├── stocks/            # Stock analysis functionality
│   ├── fixed_interest/    # Fixed income analysis
│   └── portfolio/         # Portfolio management
├── common/                # Shared utilities
└── base_configs/          # Default configurations
```

## Common Patterns

### Configuration Management
- Use `ymlInput()` for YAML file processing
- Convert configurations to `AttributeDict` for flexible access
- Validate required configuration keys before processing

### Module Implementation
- Implement a `router()` method for each module
- Use consistent naming conventions for analysis methods
- Return structured data that can be saved to YAML/CSV

### Data Processing
- Leverage `assetutilities` for common operations
- Use `FileManagement` for consistent file operations
- Implement proper logging for analysis workflows

## Key Features to Preserve

### Technical Analysis Capabilities
- Maintain existing indicator calculations (CFM, EOM, volatility)
- Preserve insider trading analysis functionality
- Keep portfolio tracking and investment value calculations

### Data Integration
- Support multiple financial data sources
- Maintain backwards compatibility with existing data formats
- Preserve test data and expected results

## Development Workflow

1. Create feature branches for new development
2. Use Poetry for dependency management
3. Run tests with pytest before committing
4. Format code with Black and organize imports with isort
5. Update documentation for new features

## Agent OS Integration

This project uses Agent OS for development planning and execution. Key commands:
- Use `/create-spec` for new feature planning
- Reference product documentation in `.agent-os/product/`
- Follow the roadmap in `.agent-os/product/roadmap.md`

## Available Commands

- **Create-Module-Agent:** Available via `/create-module-agent` command
