# AssetHold Technical Decisions

## Architecture Decisions

### Modular Engine Design
**Decision**: Implemented a central engine with module-specific routers
**Rationale**: Enables easy extension of analysis capabilities while maintaining consistent configuration and data handling patterns
**Implementation**: `engine.py` serves as the main entry point, delegating to module routers (stocks, portfolio, etc.)

### YAML-based Configuration
**Decision**: Use YAML files for all configuration and test specifications
**Rationale**: Human-readable, version-controllable, and flexible for complex nested configurations
**Implementation**: `ymlInput` utility handles YAML parsing with `AttributeDict` for dynamic access

### Poetry for Dependency Management
**Decision**: Chose Poetry over pip/requirements.txt
**Rationale**: Better dependency resolution, lock files for reproducible builds, and integrated packaging
**Current State**: Minimal dependencies in pyproject.toml, room for growth

### Custom Utility Library
**Decision**: Separate `assetutilities` library for common functionality
**Rationale**: Reusable components across multiple projects, cleaner separation of concerns
**Implementation**: Local development dependency with utilities for data handling, file management

## Data Management Decisions

### File-based Data Storage
**Decision**: Use local files (CSV, JSON) for data persistence
**Rationale**: Simple deployment, no database dependencies, easy backup and version control
**Trade-offs**: Limited scalability but appropriate for current user base

### Multiple Data Source Strategy
**Decision**: Support multiple financial data providers
**Rationale**: Reduces dependency on single provider, enables data validation through comparison
**Implementation**: Abstracted data access through common interfaces

## 2025-07-30: Agent OS Development Methodology Adoption

**ID:** DEC-015
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Process
**Related Spec:** @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-30-agent-os-integration/

### Decision

Adopt buildermethods Agent OS development methodology for structured feature development, comprehensive product documentation, and systematic development workflows while preserving all existing functionality and architecture.

### Context

AssetHold has reached maturity as a financial analysis platform with comprehensive functionality across stocks, real estate, and portfolio management. To support continued growth and enable structured development of new features, we need established development workflows that maintain our high standards for financial accuracy while improving development velocity and documentation quality.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Structured development workflows for new financial analysis features
- Comprehensive product documentation reflecting our mature platform capabilities
- Systematic approach to breaking down complex financial modeling tasks
- Clear development standards specifically adapted for financial software
- Enhanced ability to onboard new contributors to the project

**Negative:**
- Additional documentation overhead for new feature development
- Learning curve for developers to adopt Agent OS command workflows
- Potential initial slowdown as team adapts to new development processes

## Development Process Decisions

### Comprehensive Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Extensive test suite with YAML-based test fixtures
**Rationale**: Financial calculations require high accuracy, test fixtures enable easy test case management
**Implementation**: Separate test modules mirroring source structure

### Legacy Code Preservation
**Decision**: Keep legacy Flask application in codebase
**Rationale**: Preserve working web interface while developing new architecture
**Location**: `src/assethold/legacy_code/`

## Feature Implementation Decisions

### Technical Analysis Focus
**Decision**: Prioritize technical indicators over fundamental analysis
**Rationale**: Aligns with target user needs for trend-based investment decisions
**Current State**: Multiple indicators implemented (CFM, EOM, volatility, strength)

### Insider Trading Analysis
**Decision**: Comprehensive insider trading tracking and analysis
**Rationale**: Valuable signal for individual investors, differentiates from basic charting tools
**Implementation**: Timeline, relation-based, and volume analysis

### Real Estate Module Inclusion
**Decision**: Include real estate analysis alongside stock analysis
**Rationale**: Supports holistic investment approach for target users
**Scope**: Commercial and residential property analysis tools

## Future Architecture Considerations

### Scalability Preparation
- Modular design enables easy addition of new analysis types
- Router pattern supports performance optimization through caching
- Configuration system can adapt to more complex requirements

### Integration Readiness
- Clean module boundaries enable API development
- Data abstractions support multiple storage backends
- Testing framework scales with feature additions

### Performance Optimization
- File-based storage allows for caching strategies
- Modular architecture enables selective loading
- YAML configuration supports performance tuning parameters
