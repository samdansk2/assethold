# Tests Specification

This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-30-agent-os-integration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-30
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**Agent OS Documentation Structure**
- Verify all required `.agent-os/product/` files are created with proper structure
- Validate YAML front matter and markdown formatting in all documentation files
- Test that file references using @ syntax resolve correctly to actual file paths

**Development Standards Validation**
- Test that development standards documentation follows established patterns
- Verify financial domain best practices are properly documented
- Validate Python package standards align with existing Poetry and pytest configuration

### Integration Tests

**Agent OS Command Integration**
- Test `/create-spec` command creates proper spec documentation structure
- Verify `/execute-tasks` command integrates with existing testing infrastructure
- Test that Agent OS workflows preserve existing development tool integration (Black, isort, mypy)

**Existing Functionality Preservation**
- Run full existing test suite to ensure no regressions
- Verify all existing modules (stocks, multifamily, fixed_interest) continue to function
- Test that existing YAML configurations and data processing workflows remain intact

**Documentation Cross-References**
- Test that all @ file references in documentation resolve to actual files
- Verify Agent OS documentation integrates properly with existing CLAUDE.md
- Test that roadmap reflects actual implementation status across all modules

### Feature Tests

**Complete Agent OS Workflow**
- End-to-end test of creating a new financial analysis feature using Agent OS commands
- Test complete workflow from `/create-spec` through implementation to deployment
- Verify that financial domain standards are enforced throughout development process

**Financial Data Validation Workflows**
- Test that financial calculation testing standards are properly implemented
- Verify data validation requirements are documented and enforceable
- Test regulatory compliance considerations are integrated into development workflows

### Mocking Requirements

**File System Operations:** Mock file creation and modification operations during testing
- Strategy: Use temporary directories for testing Agent OS file structure creation
- Purpose: Avoid modifying actual project structure during testing

**External Financial Data Sources:** Mock API calls to financial data providers
- Strategy: Use existing test data and fixtures for financial calculations
- Purpose: Ensure tests remain fast and don't require external API access

**Git Operations:** Mock git commands for branch creation and commit operations
- Strategy: Use git test repositories or mock git command execution
- Purpose: Test Agent OS git integration without affecting actual repository history
