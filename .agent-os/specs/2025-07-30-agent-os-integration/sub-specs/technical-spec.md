# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-30-agent-os-integration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-30
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- Create `.agent-os/product/` directory structure with mission, roadmap, tech-stack, and decisions documentation
- Establish Python package-specific development standards that complement existing Poetry and pytest workflows
- Define financial domain best practices for data validation, calculation accuracy, and analytical transparency
- Integrate Agent OS commands with existing development tools (Black, isort, mypy) and testing infrastructure
- Preserve all existing functionality while enabling structured feature development workflows
- Document current implementation status across all modules (stocks, multifamily, fixed_interest)
- Establish clear guidelines for financial data sources, API integrations, and regulatory compliance considerations

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Full Agent OS Migration with Complete Restructuring
- Pros: Complete alignment with Agent OS standards, optimal workflow integration
- Cons: Requires significant changes to existing successful architecture, high risk of breaking existing functionality

**Option B:** Incremental Agent OS Integration Preserving Existing Architecture (Selected)
- Pros: Maintains all existing functionality, low risk, gradual adoption, leverages existing development patterns
- Cons: May not achieve full Agent OS optimization immediately

**Option C:** Agent OS Documentation Only Without Workflow Changes
- Pros: Minimal disruption, quick implementation
- Cons: Limited benefits, doesn't enable full Agent OS development workflows

**Rationale:** Option B is selected because AssetHold is a mature, functioning financial analysis platform with established patterns. The incremental approach allows us to gain Agent OS benefits while preserving the significant investment in existing architecture and functionality.

## External Dependencies

- **No New Dependencies Required** - Agent OS integration uses existing development tools
- **Justification:** AssetHold already has comprehensive tooling with Poetry, pytest, Black, and financial libraries. Agent OS integration focuses on workflow and documentation enhancement rather than adding new technical dependencies.

## Implementation Architecture

### Agent OS Product Documentation Structure
```
.agent-os/
└── product/
    ├── mission.md          # Financial analysis platform vision and user personas
    ├── tech-stack.md       # Python, Poetry, financial libraries, deployment
    ├── roadmap.md          # Feature development phases with completed Phase 0
    └── decisions.md        # Architectural and financial methodology decisions
```

### Development Standards Integration
- Extend existing CLAUDE.md with Agent OS command references
- Document Python package best practices specific to financial analysis
- Establish testing standards for financial calculations and data validation
- Define code review processes for financial accuracy and regulatory compliance

### Workflow Integration Points
- `/create-spec` command for new financial analysis features
- `/execute-tasks` command following TDD approach with financial data validation
- Spec documentation templates adapted for financial modeling and analysis workflows
