# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Agent OS Integration for AssetHold Python Package
> Created: 2025-07-30
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Complete the buildermethods Agent OS integration for the AssetHold Python package, establishing structured development workflows, comprehensive product documentation, and Python package-specific development standards tailored for financial analysis and asset management tools.

## User Stories

### Development Team Workflow Enhancement

As a developer working on the AssetHold package, I want to have structured Agent OS workflows so that I can efficiently plan, develop, and ship new financial analysis features with consistent quality and comprehensive documentation.

**Detailed Workflow:** Developers will use Agent OS commands to create detailed specs for new financial modules (stocks, real estate, portfolio management), break down complex financial modeling tasks into manageable implementation steps, and maintain comprehensive documentation of all product decisions and architectural choices.

### Financial Domain Standards

As a financial analyst using AssetHold, I want the development team to follow domain-specific best practices so that all financial calculations, data handling, and analysis workflows meet industry standards for accuracy, transparency, and regulatory compliance.

**Detailed Workflow:** The Agent OS integration will establish specific standards for financial data validation, calculation methodologies, testing of financial models, and documentation of analytical approaches to ensure all features meet professional financial analysis requirements.

### Python Package Development Excellence

As a maintainer of the AssetHold package, I want standardized Python development workflows so that the codebase maintains high quality, follows modern Python practices, and can be easily extended by new contributors.

**Detailed Workflow:** Agent OS will enforce Python-specific development standards including type hints, comprehensive testing with pytest, proper package structure with Poetry, and integration with financial data sources while maintaining modular architecture.

## Spec Scope

1. **Complete Agent OS Product Documentation** - Create comprehensive mission, roadmap, tech stack, and decisions documentation reflecting the mature AssetHold financial analysis platform
2. **Python Package Development Standards** - Establish coding standards, testing requirements, and development workflows specifically for Python financial analysis packages
3. **Financial Domain Best Practices** - Document standards for financial calculations, data validation, regulatory compliance, and analytical methodologies
4. **Development Workflow Integration** - Set up spec creation, task execution, and code review processes optimized for financial software development
5. **Legacy Code Integration Strategy** - Define approach for maintaining existing functionality while enabling modern Agent OS development workflows

## Out of Scope

- Modifying existing financial calculation algorithms or analytical methodologies
- Changing the current Poetry-based dependency management system
- Restructuring the existing modular architecture (stocks, multifamily, fixed_interest)
- Migrating legacy Flask web interfaces or existing data formats

## Expected Deliverable

1. Complete Agent OS product documentation structure in `.agent-os/product/` with mission, roadmap, tech stack, and decisions files reflecting the current state and future direction of AssetHold
2. Python and financial domain-specific development standards that complement the existing CLAUDE.md guidelines
3. Functional Agent OS workflow integration allowing developers to use `/create-spec` and `/execute-tasks` commands for new feature development
