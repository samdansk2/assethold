#### Bidding Phase

- Bidding starts at a set time
- Bidding price does not pick up until last day of bid
- Most of the bidding action happens on last day
- 
- Bid increment steps are
  - 250,000
  - 100,000
  - 50,000
  - 25,000
  - 10,000
  - 5,000
- If bid increment decreases, 
  - it means the auction is nearing its end
  - reserve price is close to the auction price
  - last few (typically 2-3 bidders) are very active and try to optimize price
- Bid can be placed manually by adding 1 more dollar to tenx recommended bid (This will throw other bidders off in last minute grab)
- Bid is typically extended 3 minute chucks
