Absolute NNN (Building ownership is tenant's)

NNN is a type of commercial real estate lease where the tenant is responsible for paying not only the rent but also all or most of the property expenses. This typically includes:
- **Property Taxes**: The tenant pays the property taxes directly or reimburses the landlord.
- **Insurance**: The tenant is responsible for obtaining and paying for property insurance.
- **Maintenance**: The tenant covers the costs of maintenance and repairs for the property.
- **Utilities**: The tenant pays for utilities such as water, electricity, and gas.
- **Common Area Maintenance (CAM)**: The tenant pays for the upkeep of common areas shared with other tenants, such as parking lots, landscaping, and hallways.
This type of lease is common in commercial real estate, particularly for retail spaces, office buildings, and industrial properties. The NNN lease structure provides landlords with a predictable income stream while transferring many of the property-related risks and responsibilities to the tenant.
