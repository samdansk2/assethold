Almost every CPA I know is a fan of S-Corps.

My firm isn't.

Here are four scenarios where they aren't great:

🏦 You want to sell your business
💰💰 You make over $700,000 per year
🕺🕺🕺 The business has multiple owners
🏢🏢🏢🏢 You want to keep profits in the company

🏦 When selling your business or raising capital, a corporation or partnership can make a lot more sense.

They are much more flexible, while s-corps are rigid and harder to sell partial interests in.

Also, if your business is in the right industry, you could even sell the company with zero capital gains tax!

💰💰 If you're in the top tax bracket, you pay less tax if you're a service-based business owner with a Corporation. This is even after taking your profits out as dividends.

Even though you're in a higher bracket, you pay tax at the corporate level before taking dividends. This drops your effective tax rate lower than an S-Corp's. (again, this is for service-based businesses)

🕺🕺🕺 S-corps are rigid. You have to pay each of the shareholders equally, and they have to take equal distributions

Partnerships and s-corps are more flexible. Compensation doesn't have to be equal.

Owners take different roles. They shouldn't have to be paid the same.

🏢🏢🏢🏢 While you can't keep all the profits in the corporation forever, you do have the option to roll profits over.

If you're in the highest tax bracket, keeping profits in the company can reduce your taxes from 41% to 21%.

Use this to time your dividends for when you need them and retain profits at a lower tax rate if you don't.
