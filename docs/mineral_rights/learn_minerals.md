Over the past 12 months, I’ve received dozens of messages from folks trying to break into oil and gas mineral rights. 

Some folks from industry, others from real estate, still others with no prior experience.

It got me thinking that there is nothing out there that teaches people step-by-step how to find, underwrite and close mineral deals.

After almost 9 months of planning, writing and filming, I’m pumped to announce the launch of Learn Minerals, a comprehensive online course and community focused on oil and gas mineral rights acquisition.

Whether you are starting from zero or you are already and og pro from different discipline, we got you covered.

The course is 14 modules and covers everything from the basic legal foundations of property and mineral ownership, to oil and gas leases, to calculating NMA’s, NRA’s and decimal interests, to running title and finding mineral ownership information, to selecting your first AOI and researching oil and gas activity, to mineral rights valuation, to getting deals under contract and closed (as a broker or end-buyer).

When you finish, you will be ready to start finding and transacting on mineral deals.

So whether you are bored out of your mind on the 49th floor in Houston and need a side-hustle, or you are ready to dive into a new career, come learn how to landman with us!
