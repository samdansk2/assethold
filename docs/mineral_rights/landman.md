Two kids from a small Texas town built a $13 BILLION oil empire with nothing but handshakes.

In 2008, Cody Campbell and John Sellers were commercial real estate developers watching their market collapse.

Instead of retreating to safe jobs, they saw an opportunity others missed:

The Texas oil industry was about to explode.

They became expert "land men" with a radically simple strategy:
• Meet landowners in diners
• Negotiate on truck hoods
• Close deals with handshakes

While others chased cheap land on the outskirts, they paid premium prices for what they called "core of the core" properties.

The strategy paid off spectacularly:

2017: Sold 70,000 acres for $2.8B

2021: Sold DoublePoint Energy for $6.4B

2025: Sold Double Eagle IV for $4.08B

Total deals: Over $13 BILLION.

But here's what most miss about their success:

It wasn't about fancy tech or slick marketing.

It was about trust.

In the oil patch, your reputation matters more than any contract.

When you're dealing in billions, people need to know your word is your bond.

This is what I've seen in 35+ years in oil & gas:

• Fortunes are made and lost
• Tech comes and goes
• But trust endures

While Silicon Valley gets headlines, energy quietly creates more millionaires than any other industry.

Why?

Because energy investments offer something rare in today's economy:

• Steady returns
• Reliable cash flow
• Protection against inflation
• Real assets producing real value

It's why my clients call it "mailbox money."

That's exactly why I created fixed-rate 10% per year bonds in energy projects.

These aren't speculative investments.

They're backed by decades of experience and real assets
