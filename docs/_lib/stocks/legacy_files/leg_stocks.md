### Index Funds

A small favor from you but a huge one for me. What is the best S&P500 index to buy? 
i.e. low fee, low commissions etc. Want to keep buying it in a broker account with USD 500 or so every month  - Thank you. 

I am currently doing the same with BRKB. Do you recommend any index other than S&P500 and BRKB?(Edited)

### Individual Stocks

Only if you know the company well. 
- After the stock price rises, at least raise the original capital back?
(or) assume that you will loose the original capital and then continue investing whole money.

Whatever psychology works for one. Accept it while investing on individual stocks.

$0 financial data terminal??

Spent some time yesterday and got my hands on Open BB, and it's phenomenal.
OpenBb is an open-source financial data platform that is looking to make itself a cost effective version of Bloomberg terminal (while it's effective, it has miles to go)

It is being developed by team led by Didier Rodrigues Lopes at the OpenBB Foundation.

How to use:
They provide
1) Terminal (Windows/MacOS)
2) Bot (Telegram/Discord. I love both of these)
3) SDK (Python. Yet to test this one, but the possibilities are endless)

It offers data like:
Fundamental Analysis (income statement, ratios, Cashflows, balance sheet)
Market data (Open, close, 52wh, 52wl, golden cross, volumes)
Option data ( IV, PCratio, etc.)
Analysis (Performance, change yoy etc.)
Economy (gdp, fed, currency, bonds etc.)
Sentiment (news analysis, trend analysis etc.)
Interactive charts
NLP based chat
and much more!

While this seems at a pilot stage, what's being offered is phenomenal.

The data sources are vast and can be added more with your respective API Keys.

For now, here's a video from the founder himself, casually going through at 2x what it offers.

Will post a video of my own walkthrough soon.
Love it Didier!
