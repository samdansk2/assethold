### Customer Email | 30yr Fixed Home Loan

Mark,

We outlined the timelines below. 


Given your vast experience and volume of customers, this market volatility is not new to you.

We believe that there is a communication breakdown in your systems. Given your experience you definitely should have a solution for our situation. I am very optimistic that you can help us push some right buttons and still get us 6.5% or 6.625%. 


Thank you,
