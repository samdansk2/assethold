### Farmfolio

A well oiled system where they:
- Identify opportunity land
- Develop farm land (i.e. grow trees)
- Produce
- Sell produce by tonnage (at the farm itself)
Downstream (out of scope for Las Lamos)
- 

- Semi-annual statements and updates

Key Questions:
- In the event we want to exit the investment, say in yr 3, what is the method used? Do we need a counter party before we exit? Also, do we have any sales fees etc that we have take into account?

When you choose to exit, Farmfolio will facilitate the resale. We will list and coordinate the sale with the new buyer. We have a subscriber base of over 15,000 and growing. There is a $250 flat fee to cover title transfer + 3% broker fee to cover relisting & marketing for sale.


Objective: should we participate in 1 LOT of Farmfolio to gain experience for implementation in India?
