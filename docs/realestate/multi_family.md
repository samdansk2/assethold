## Introduction

Multi-family is:
- Two or more rental units (Mainly personal assets drive)
- Five or more considered commercial for loan purposes (Economies of scale)
- Single or multiple tax parcels ()
- Units + common areas (Fitness center, pool, etc.)
- Fee simple (everything is owned) or ground lease (land owned by someone else)
- Short-term rentals
    - Generally 12 to 24 months
    - 6 month rental comes with caveats/fees

Who invests (owns and operates) in multi-family:
- Wealthy individuals/family
- small private syndicators
- Pension funds
- Large private equity funds

Why multifamily
- Strong historical performance
- Greater diversity in tenant base
- Everyone needs a place to live

## Financing Requirements


- Needs an accredited real-estate investor for getting bank financing (Chava willing to help? i.e. requirements are 3 yr experience + 300+ units etc.)
- Need 250k each from investors (Identify). A good incentivising plan will empower them
- Do not skimp on management fees (1%). Take it as taking a dollar or multiple dollars will make you a villian

#### Financing Example 1

Multifamily Financing: Locking long term interest rates when rates are high. Does it ever make sense? Are there loans that allow you to capitalize if/when rates come down in the future?
The answer is YES!

With HUD financing, we have the ability to lower your interest rate if rates come down in the future. We can do this a few different ways, including a simple Interest Rate Reduction, which is a super simple process without increasing your loan amount, and no costs/fees other than legal and title update.

HUD loans are also a declining prepay structure as opposed to yield maintenance or defeasance, and, we have the ability to customize the declining prepay structure to work with your business plans. For example, if you're anticipating a capital event to take place in year 4, we can structure the prepay for that benefit for there to be minimal or even no prepay at that time.

Not to forget, we underwrite to 1.176x DSCR on a 35 year amortization (and a 35 year term, fixed) at an 85% LTV. For affordable properties, we can go as low as a 1.11x DSCR and 90% LTV. Rates today are the in low 5%'s, non-recourse, fixed.

Please reach out if you'd like my team and I to size a loan for you.

Q/ n. Arent we paying a penalty in the form of a higher rate when we ask for an Interest rate reduction?

It's my understanding that the bondholder will get prepaid with a penalty and a new bond is put in place with a higher rate coupon than it would have been had it been a brand new loan to recoup the prepay penalty. So basically we wouldn't get a full rate reduction inline with the index.


A/ As an example, if your rate is locked today at 5%, and your prepayment penalty schedule is 10% in year one, declining 1% each year. Then, in 3 years from now, new HUD rates are now at 3%. If we were to do a HUD IRR (Interest Rate Reduction), you are correct, you wouldn't be able to lock your new rate at 3%, it may be closer to 3.50% to compensate for the 7% prepayment penalty that the bondholder will receive. 3.50% is much better than 5%, especially when you can do that right after locking a 35 year fixed mortgage :). I would also encourage you to connect with your CPA to see how/if you can write off the 7% prepayment penalty even though you aren't paying it upfront (you're paying it by virtue of the slightly higher rate). 

However, there is another option to reduce your interest rate with a HUD loan where we could put the prepayment penalty into the loan amount (so you're financing the penalty) in lieu of a higher rate - so, yes, you could be in a position to secure the new lower HUD rates in the future. 

If rates go down once your prepay penalty is 0% (typically 10 years of a prepay), then, yes, your new rate would be where the market HUD rates are. 

If rates never go down, then you did a great job locking when you did! 

Follow up A/ Reuben thank you so much for explaining it with an example. Very clear now. So while we do need to pay the prepay penalty one way or another, the fact that we have the ability to lower the rate in the future without a refi and lock it down for 30-40 years is very valuable if the business plan calls for a long-term hold.

A couple people have asked me why I am so negative on Class B & C Value Add Multi-Family investing in many secondary markets around the US aka acting like Dr Doom.

The answer is fairly simple, recently people have made far too much money in a relatively easy part of Real Estate.

What I mean by that is many aspects of Real Estate are hard. Buying a retail property and curating the right tenant mix so the project thrives is hard. Entitling land in say California for development is hard. Developing any sort of real estate project on time and on budget is hard. Creating affordable housing is hard. By hard I mean it takes a a lot of tenacity, nuance and skill. It took my ten years of grinding in Office properties before I was in a position to raise capital confidently for my own Value Add Office projects which can be incredibly hard to turn around.

Seeing all these groups who have bought an existing Class B or C multi family project in a Secondary market, very marginally improve it, and then flip it for massive profits within 12-24 months to a greater fool…that is not hard at all and it’s mainly luck. Value Add Multi-Family investing is typically a get rich slow conservative part of our business where you hit singles and maybe doubles but not Grand Slams.

My belief is many of these newer groups will get crushed this downturn and this idea of Real Estate investing being easy goes away for a while because too many people jumped into it. Too many thought this run would last forever, rents would go up forever, Demand would never slow, and now many factors including the Federal Reserve and large amounts of new supply are making sure it ends.

Real Estate Investing should be hard and that’s a good thing. It’s for people who have been properly trained and know what they are doing. It’s an almost sacred act to raise money from people to invest with you.

For the younger generation, remember you want to be in Hard aspects of Real Estate. You want to develop specific knowledge that is difficult to replicate so you can survive cycles and create strong opportunities to generate real wealth and improve the communities you work in. You don’t want to do easy things in real estate. Stick to learning real estate skills that are hard and nuanced. It’s served me well throughout my career and what makes me confident about dealing with any challenges the market brings.

Cooling fundamentals add another headwind for multifamily investors already grappling with rising interest rates. And lots of dry powder out there ready to pounce upon any signs of distress and forced-sale situations. And while apartment transactions will undoubtedly feel some impact, let's not suddenly forget how resilient this sector has been.

1) Loan-to-value ratios have held well below pre-GFC norms in this cycle, and nosedived further in recent months as rates soared. There is a false notion among the housing bears that all multifamily and SFR buyers are highly leveraged to the moon. That's just not true. LTVs held around 65% and more recently headed toward 55%. Even if there's a pretty sizable price correction (still a huge "if"), lenders have built in more cushion this cycle.

2) Debt service coverage ratios have also been healthier this cycle, per RCA, averaging in 1.5-1.8 range versus 1.3-1.5 in the mid-2000s.

3) Obviously the biggest question mark is what happens for assets (and new construction) approaching refinancing. I'm guessing some owners who initially planned the refi route will consider selling instead, but will that lead to a flood of inventory on the market pushing down pricing? We'll see. There's still a lottttt of dry powder out there scheming for exactly this scenario. Will some owners/sellers take a big hit? Sure, but given the long-term tailwinds for rental housing, it's very difficult to see a mass distress / fire-sale situation emerge. My guess is the capital will find a way.

4) Investors still love multifamily / SFR (relative to other options) and lower yields reflect maturation of the asset class. The linkage between interest rates and cap rates tends to be overstated, though some cap rate expansion is occurring and likely will continue.

5) Lastly: I'm not saying this is where we're headed, but just for hypothetical comparisons... In the 2008-2009 downturn, demand plunged while supply surged and the result? U.S. apartment occupancy bottomed out at 92%. Ninety-two percent. (And then surged back upward quickly in 2010 as demand returned.) Remember that people can work from anywhere, order food from anywhere, shop from anywhere ... but they need a place to live. That's a structural long-term tailwind for rental housing of all types. Demand is cyclical, yes, and the road can be bumpy. But long-term tailwinds tend to win out in the long run.

Excellent deep dive into the impact of inflation on "landlords" in The New York Times -- an angle we rarely see covered in the media with all the focus on rents. There's a persistent myth that all "landlords" are just printing money off rent increases. And while most have certainly fared well (not downplaying that), the reality is that rapidly rising costs (especially property taxes, payroll, maintenance, utilities, insurance) are trimming profits more than most people think.

Few notable pieces of the article:

1) “It’s ironic, because our net operating margins have not gone up, actually they’ve gone down. Yes, the rent growth is there, but it has to sustain there for a while because of the costs going up.” -- Swapnil Agarwal of Nitya Capital.

2) “I think this inflationary environment is a more negative to landlords than it is a positive. Most landlords would tell you, ‘I really liked 2021.’ Things were coming back, interest rates were low, things seemed to be going relatively easy; 2022 is a bitch.” -- Steve Schwat of UIP.

3) Smaller "landlords" seem most impacted, particularly those under rent controls in places like New York. Even where rent control not in places, some small rental housing providers have not increased rents in line with expenses due to fear of resident turnover and inability to backfill units -- which, by the way, was usually a very misguided fear in 2021 and early 2022.

4) “Whether our costs went to zero, or our costs double, it might have some effect (on rents). But for most people, it’s 100 percent supply. That’s what’s driving rents. If there are 10 other similar vacant units available, all of our rents are going to come down.” - Ryan Vienneau of Veno Properties.

And Ryan's point is an excellent one -- stating the obvious, but an obvious fact that many cynics refuse to acknowledge. Rents are tied to demand. If you increase rents to unaffordable levels, units sit vacant, and "landlords" make $0 on vacant units.

That was my point to The New York Times, which the reporter was nice enough to include in her article. It's about renter demand and renter incomes -- which drove rents up the last couple years, (although that tide is now shifting due to waning consumer confidence dinging household formation and thus weakening demand).

5) The reality is that rents can only rise as incomes rise,” said Jay Parsons, chief economist at the real estate data firm RealPage, noting that rent averages 23 percent of the monthly incomes across the apartments they track. “If people can’t afford it, you can’t lease it.”


## Rent Sensitivity

Here's one of the most widely misunderstood realities of rent growth and rental affordability in the U.S.: The renters seeing the largest rent hikes are upper-income households living in the most expensive rentals. And despite larger rent hikes, these renters are least likely to miss a rent payment. On the flip side, rent payments have fallen the most in subsidized affordable housing -- where rents have grown the least, since those rents are typically set to a share of income.

So it's not all about the rent, clearly.

The average renter in market-rate Class A and B have seen rents increased 14-15% since March 2020. (These are actual in-place rents, not asking rents.) Those renters are paying 96-97% of the rent due each month, which is off 1 percentage point from pre-COVID levels.

Why are these renters able to keep paying higher rents at essentially normal levels? Well, it all comes back to income. Class A and B renter households have seen incomes rise nearly as fast as rent (among new lease signers, where income is tracked at signing). A typical Class A renter household (including roommates) now has annual income of $135,000, while a typical Class B renter household is $99,600.

It's a different story in Class C, also sometimes called "workforce housing." Household incomes in Class C have grown, too, but annual wages remain lower at $62,000. While Class C in-place rents grew a lesser (but still significant) 10% since March 2020, we've seen a bit more distress is this group. Class C rent collections were lower than A/B pre-COVID, and that gap has widened a bit more since COVID hit.

And it's even more challenging in the subsidized Affordable Housing space. Affordable typically locks the rent at a level relative to income (specific programs can vary). But that rent stability hasn't been enough to help all Affordable renters. In fact, rent collections have fallen about 4 ppts since COVID hit to just under 87%.

Takeaways:

1) Renters in Class C and Affordable are most price sensitive, but it's not all about the rent. When other consumer costs skyrocket (like groceries up 13%), there's less money available to pay rent for some households.

2) Renters making the highest incomes tend to pay the largest rent increases. This is why it's SO CRITICAL to segment the rental market. Too many pundits paint it with a very broad brush that distorts the facts around rental affordability.

3) No matter how you slice it, actual rent collections are significantly higher than what the experimental and tiny Census Household Pulse Survey is showing. The Census itself warns that their rent payment surveys have major statistical holes, yet those warnings are routinely disregarded by those who use their data.

### Rent Concessions

Is use of rent giveaways to boost apartment demand about to move up meaningfully?

That’s certainly a possibility, as leasing volumes in 3Q proved more sluggish than many owners and operators were anticipating, and now we’re moving into the cold weather months when there’s a seasonally normal letdown in demand.
 
Only about 8 percent of the available units in stabilized properties were offered with a pricing concession during prime leasing season's summer months. (Examining the stabilized stock simply means that the analysis excludes brand new completions still building an initial resident base. Price discounts at lease-up properties are not unusual.) Going back to the early 2020 pre-COVID days, that share of product with rent giveaways was roughly 20 percent, a figure than had been maintained for five years or so.
 
What’s perhaps surprising at this point is WHERE rent discounts have been offered of late, as the concession leaders in summer 2022 were not the usual suspects.
 
Starting right at the top, Minneapolis-St. Paul has been summer 2022's rent giveaway leader. Concessions were part of the pricing plan for 17 percent of the available units in stabilized properties there. The Twin Cities area normally is one of the country’s apartment occupancy leaders, and that usually means few discounts during prime leasing season. (Leasing activity is slow during Minnesota’s brutal winters, so use of concessions surges then.)
 
Other not-the-normal markets featuring meaningful rent discounts during recent months included San Jose, Seattle, Oakland, Washington DC, Portland, Los Angeles and Boston.
 
On the other hand, concession frequency tends to run a little above the national norm in Chicago, and both Houston and San Antonio typically register some of the country’s heaviest use of rent discounts.


# Cap Rate vs. LTV

CAP RATE AND LTV RELATIONSHIP
Cap Rate LTV
4.50% 50%
5.00% 56%
5.50% 61%
6.00% 67%
6.50% 73%
6.75% 75%

With the 10 year US Treasury up to 4.20 %, current fixed interest rates for max leverage Agency loans are roughly 6.00%.

I talk to a lot of market participants who are looking for deals and trying to find the level where cap rates and purchase prices make sense. Often, the amount of leverage available is a big factor in the price that can be offered.

With that in mind, the maximum leverage for a given cap rate at a 1.25x DSCR (based on current interest rates for a perm loan) is as follows:

Cap Rate LTV
4.50% 50%
5.00% 56%
5.50% 61%
6.00% 67%
6.50% 73%
6.75% 75%

We'll certainly work with you to see where we can get aggressive on the underwriting, but these are accurate for a calculated cap rate based on our underwritten Net Cash Flow.

In some circumstances, our capital partners may get more aggressive on either the minimum DSCR or the amortization period, and I am always happy to discuss what those exceptions may be. But this is a good guide as you are evaluating potential acquisitions.

# Cap Rates

Should We Throw Cap Rates Out the Window?

Everywhere you turn people are talking about the changes in values. On the news, reporters are talking about home values going down; in commercial real estate, lenders and brokers are talking about the cap rate expansion (which signifies declines in values). With everyone talking about values going down, it must be true, right?!?
 
Before I address this question, I want to first address the definition of value. One definition of value is the estimate of the monetary worth of something. So how do we “estimate” the monetary worth? 
 
In residential real estate we have historically used the comparable sales approach. This allows a similar house’s sale to be used as a benchmark to determine the price point in which a comparable house should transact. In commercial real estate there are three ways in which to estimate the monetary worth. First, is the comparable sales approach. Second is the replacement value approach (think of how insurance companies perform an appraisal to determine the cost to rebuild a structure in the case of a catastrophic event). And third is the Net Income Approach (or NOI Approach) in which the property’s annualized profits minus expenses are divided by the trading market cap rate. Historically, the NOI Approach has been the preferred method for investors when purchasing commercial real estate, but is that about to change?
 
As interest rates continue to creep up there is a trickle down effect on the trading cap rates. In other words the market cools down as the debt (the largest part of the capital stack) becomes more expensive and in turn decreases what one can pay for a property. The problem with the NOI evaluation method in this scenario is the lag time between interest rates impacting cap rates. The other problem is typically a rise in interest rates inadvertently impacts other commodities, for example building materials. Thus, replacement values surge. To put this in perspective, if you looked at an apartment in Q1 2022 the asking price could have been 180k/door. Today, with the current interest rates, let’s say you can only pay 150k/door. However, if you were to rebuild that same property, maybe you can only do it for 175k/door.  So, what is the value?

## Evictions

We’re likely to see more headlines about rising eviction filings (which are always a lose/lose), but be careful how we interpret this. Context does matter. A few facts to consider:

1) Most eviction filings reflect long-standing cases of chronic non-payment, which have become backlogged after (in some cities) 2+ years of eviction moratoria. But given moratoria and backed-up judicial processes, it takes time work through the backlog. As we mentioned back in summer 2020, a temporary and short-term spike in eviction filings was unfortunately always inevitable once bans expired.

2) Delinquency is growing among that same small share of renters chronically behind on rent, but (in the market-rate apartment market) the share of renters behind on rent is NOT expanding, as illustrated in this chart.

3) Renters deserve the most credit for paying rent. No one wants to give them any credit. Despite what we hear, note that there’s absolutely no correlation between stimulus programs and market-rate rent collections. Did they help? Absolutely, but the No. 1 driver was clearly a renter base able and willing to pay rent. But…

4) It’s a different story in true, project-based affordable housing. Despite lower rents and smaller rent increases, the share of rent unpaid has come in around 12-14% each month, up from around 10% prior to COVID. (Collections in the Affordable market track more in line with rental assistance and stimulus programs.) Eviction risks could be more concentrated in the Affordable market – underscoring the need for targeted aid.

5) There are many carefully cropped charts circulating that show eviction filings from March 2020 onward, and conclude that evictions are surging. A truer picture of eviction filings must go back to 2019 or earlier as a legitimate baseline, since few evictions were permitted in 2020 or 2021.

6) Remember that eviction FILINGS (which are what get reported) are not the same thing as actual evictions. While the Eviction Lab has become a go-to source for filings, there are no good data sources for actual evictions, unfortunately. But the number of actual evictions would be significantly lower than filings.

7) The real challenge has been and remains the severe shortage of subsidized low-income housing. We are 7+ mm units short. We can't solve that via <1mm market-rate vacancies. Push Congress to pass the White House plan for $200+ in spending for affordable housing. If we had a proper backstop via affordable housing and targeted rental aid, more Americans would be safely / adequately housed.

Last thought: It would make sense to exercise compassion and flexibility with any newly emerging cases of distress -- both for empathy (the right thing to do) and for the bottom line, given the lack of new lease demand and likely challenges backfilling vacant units.


# Real Estate Cycle

## Navigating The Cylical Market

How to survive a Real Estate cycle
 
Ok so we are all in agreement that the markets have turned and we are officially in the down part of a real estate cycle. If you don’t believe me just look at how far REIT stocks are off in values in 2022. Now some property types like Office will experience more then say Industrial or Multifamily but every property type is going to experience issues in its own ways.

So how does this cycle go and what does the future hold...I am not sure. Every cycle is different and plays out differently.

BUT, and a big BUT, there are certain lessons I learned from graduating college in 2003 into a recession and then surviving the GFC from 2007-2009 in terms of how to survive tougher economic environments. Some of these are universal principals that any younger real estate professional can use.
 
Cash - It is king right now. Get as much of it together as possible. Get your personal house in order. Check all your finances and make sure you are being frugal where you can. Pay down debt and be smart with your spending. I moved in with my in-laws during the GFC after graduate school to save money.

Be Comfortable Being Uncomfortable - Its uncomfortable going into and through a cycle. If you have gotten into the business after 2010, this is new to you. Be ok with that. Own the fact its uncomfortable. Its uncomfortable for everyone. People like certainty and right now it does not exist. It candidly never does but you feel it more in Down cycles.

Build as many relationships as possible - Relationships are the true currency of Real Estate. Your success in this business will be in many ways a direct correlation to how strong your relationships are. It has never been easier to connect with people too via LinkeIn, Zoom calls, etc. The good news is as transactions volumes slow, its never easier to meet with people too.

Find some hobbies - During the GFC I got really into triathlons with a couple buddies. It gave me something to focus on outside of real estate and set goals and have a purpose. I really enjoyed them and when I finished a race it felt like I accomplished something special. There are plenty of ways to keep your mind busy outside of work.
 
One Day at a Time - Have this mindset. Things do not change overnight and take things as they come, one day at a time. Do not lose site of your overall vision for your career. Focus on what you can control and take steps to stick to your vision. I saw the markets shift in 2007 so I went back to graduate school to stay on offensive with my career even during a down turn.

Remember at the end of every down turn is an up market too!

If anyone has thoughts on how to survive a cycle from your experiences please comment too.

# Data Sources

Apartment List provides a pretty good summary although I think it’s understates growth rates. You’ll start to see these charts show -5 drops in the coming months. When broad data shows a -5% drop, it means many properties are also dropping -10 to -15%. Peak to trough GFC, data only showed a -4% drop but there were obviously many properties that experienced more significant drops.

RealPage has been putting good data on this too. So far it seems seasonal. The volatility should be larger given the high short term growth rate.

# 1980s Lessons Learnt

re_multifamily\1980s_lessons_learnt.pdf

"The best deals you do sometimes are the ones you don't do"

I am in the History Lesson mode because remember History has a funny way of repeating itself.

When I was in graduate school back sometime in 2008 or 2009 when the Real Estate markets were falling a part, I got this great document emailed to me from the late 80's written by the partners back then in Trammell Crow's Southwest business.

It was basically a summary of the lessons all the partners learned from that large down cycle related to the S&L crisis and what they would do differently next time around.

It is a fascinating and timeless read and am thankful my former student Christopher Schade sent it to me as I had lost my copy of it.

Now times are different now meaning one of the partners talks about how to save money not everyone needs a Computer and Type Writers are still good.

But what's amazing is how much of it provided these Timeless truths.

The key Lessons I took from it were:

Cash is King - This is always obvious and not sure why it takes downturns to know this.

Think Scared - Always underwrite Downside scenario's and think what could happen if things go wrong. A number of the partners discussed how they wish they have looked at Downside scenarios in projects they acquired.

Acquiring Land - Do not use debt because Land has no Cash Flow to it and its the first thing to lose value in a downturn.

The best deals you do sometimes are the ones you don't do - This was a major recurring one. Many of the Partners talked about the deals they wish they did not do. That they did deals because money was available and they could do it but then they regretted it. This is such a crucial point and one of the toughest parts of the Development/Investment business in terms of having the confidence and discipline not to pursue aggressive or risky opportunities even when the capital is there.

Enjoy the reading and stepping back in time a bit.

As we enter 2023, to me in Real Estate its time to "Stay Alive to '25"

Back during the GFC I heard over and over again the Mantra for Real Estate professionals during the S&L crisis of "Stay Alive to '95". Back then the RTC (By the way if the terms GFC, S&L crisis, or RTC mean nothing to you well starting using Google asap) was set up and it was projected by many to take until about 1995 for them to sell all the bad real estate and for the markets to heal.

We are definitely in a very soft period of time in the markets, different from the RTC and GFC days but soft nonetheless, and the goal for every Real Estate professional should be to have the attitude of "Stay Alive to '25".

Things are getting tough and will only get much harder in Real Estate before they get better. We are just now seeing the impacts of severely decreased transaction volume in the second half of 2022. That's the sign the water is rushing back out into the ocean because the bigger waves are about to hit. Those big waves are a pending recession impacting NOI of all property types as tenant demand is reduced, loans coming due that can not be refinanced in this higher interest rate environment, higher cap rates pushing down valuations, record levels of new Industrial and Multi-Family supply being delivered, and a lot less capital out there because groups are dealing with problem real estate assets (Especially Office) and many do not want to catch a falling knife which means fees dry up.

For the younger professionals these next 18-24 months are going to to be your "Welcome to Real Estate" lesson. By 2025 a lot of the bad deals done this cycle will hopefully be flushed through the system and we will be far on the other side of a recession.

I know for many real estate professionals this could be tough to hear as anyone who entered the business after 2010 probably felt like Real Estate was an easy and fun business. Real Estate is not even close to an "Easy" business. Its a really difficult and hard business not for the faint of heart. The reason is how cyclical our business is and how tough the down cycles are. Don't believe me, ask anyone about their GFC or S&L crisis stories.

And candidly that's exactly why I love this industry. In many ways this business is really about the internal fortitude one has to have to push through a Down cycle. To grind each day knowing you might not have anything to show for it but you keep pushing forward anyways.

So my advice entering 2023 is simple, "Stay Alive to '25" or as younger professionals say it #stayaliveto25

This is the time when you prove you have what it takes to be a true Real Estate professional. It will not be easy and again you might want to ring that bell and quit, but don't. There is another Great market waiting on the other side of this mountain we all have to climb. And as Buzz Oates would say once you make it through a cycle, you are officially in Real Estate too!


## Case Study | 8 Unit Property

https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7018560912471064577?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios

We bought an 8-unit rental property to put our kids through college tax-free.

Here's the breakdown. 👇

Our kiddos are 9 yo and under.

They had $60K saved from gifts, grandparents, etc.

We had 3 options:
1) Leave in savings earning 0.01%
2) Open a 529 savings plan
3) Buy real estate

We chose the obvious option. 🏡

The problem: we found an amazing (unaffordable) 8-plex.

Purchase Price: $450K
We budgeted for $240K

So we increased the leverage.

How?

👉 Buyer's commission of $50K.

__

New Purchase Price: $500K
Buyer Commission: $50K
Down Payment: $75K
Loan Amount: $375K

I chipped in $15K that my kids will pay back with cash flow in year 1.

Then it's 100% their property.

Annual Rents = $75K
(Annual Expenses) = $40K
(Annual Mortgage) = $22.5K
✅ Net Cash Flow = $12,500

Plus appreciation over 10 years.
Plus a cash-out refinance in 10 years.

(The refi in 10 years is 🔑)

Great alt-savings plan for college.

Not a bad way to teach your kiddos how to build wealth, either!


## Case Study | Selling Property

You have a $10M offer on the table.

But it will cost you $3.71M in tax.

Secure your bag and get the whole $10M 👇

Here's the deal:

You are about to sell your company for $10M.

It's a corporation that's eligible for QSBS treatment. This means the first $10M of capital gain is tax-free! (see Monday's post)

The catch?

You have to hold the stock for 5 years, and you've only owned the company for 4.

The buyer is motivated and won't wait another year.

What do you do?

You could hope for another buyer. Maybe you'll get more money?

Not a bad option, but doing a section 1045 rollover might make more sense!

Section 1045 allows you to roll over your QSBS stock into other QSBS and defer the capital gain!

If you've held the first QSBS stock for at least 6 months, doing a rollover can help you meet the 5-year holding period.

This means you can avoid the capital gains tax entirely if you roll it over and meet the holding period.

The risk?

You've got to find another company that qualifies. And since qualifying companies usually aren't publicly traded, you might not get liquidity for a while.

To mitigate this risk you could choose to roll over just a part of your proceeds.

And, of course, I have other ideas on how to defer the gain further or reduce your tax.

But you're going to have to stay tuned! (🔔)

### 2023 Outlook

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnburns7_dallas-denver-phoenix-activity-7020777330264465408-LRSe

With all eyes on inflation, here is what a sample of what home builders told us they are seeing in construction costs:

#Dallas builder: “Hard costs continue to dip on average $3K-$5K per month. We are pushing back hard to lower our average labor and material costs. They must come down to reflect lower home selling prices.”

#Denver builder: “Almost all the home builders I am talking to are working on cost reductions. They range from -5% to -8% per plan.”

#Phoenix builder: “Front end trade partners are starting to reduce costs from their profits and some labor.”

#RichmondVA builder: “Expect costs to moderate or reverse somewhat in 2023 as contractors and suppliers chase their slice of a shrinking pie.”

#RiversideSanBernardino builder: “Costs were still going up throughout most of 2022. We are now working our way back down.”

#Sacramento builder: “Costs are slowly coming down. Down by about 5% in aggregate from peak in summer 2022.”

#SanAntonio builder: “As we finished out 2022, the trades still were busy, so they were not feeling the effects of the market cooling. They are already starting to feel that now.”

#SanDiego builder: “Since our production is nearly 6 months old, the costs are embedded. We certainly think better days are ahead. They had better be.”

#Seattle builder: “We have seen very few price increase letters for 2023, and actually a few decrease notifications.”

#WashingtonDC builder: “We have not been accepting any cost increases for the last 6 months.”

### 2023 Types of Deals

There seem to be two choices in #Multifamily investing right now:

1) Buy deals with assumable fixed rate debt at a #HIGH basis:

Sellers that have long term fixed rate debt on their assets typically are in no rush to sell. If they are cashflowing, there is no reason for them to sell unless they get a fantastic price.

And because there is no loan #maturity, if they do not get that fantastic price they will simply sit on their cashflow until interest rates go down again...

On these deals, you'd need to overpay to get your foot in the door. That said, you could feasibly #cashflow the property comfortably within the first couple of years of ownership.

Your downside would be protected with the fixed rate #debt.

2) Buy deals with new debt at a #GOOD basis:

Sellers that have a loan maturity or negative cashflow due to a run up in floating rate debt NEED to sell. And they have no way to simply wait out the high interest rates.

On such deals, #sponsors could buy the deal at a great basis.

But because their own debt is expensive, these deals are still showing #negative leverage going in.

Ultimately, despite the fact that you're paying less per foot, you will likely have #LESS cashflow over the life of the hold.

Conclusion: I'm constantly contemplating what is the better option. Should I overpay for cashflow and downside protection?

Or should I buy for basis with expensive debt and hope I make my money through increased value?

It's a question I think a lot of operators are thinking about these days.

Would love everyone's thoughts on this...

#### 2023 1031 Exchange

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ryancarriere_realestate-1031exchange-taxes-activity-7025831564617928704-EJrI?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop

If you’re in a partnership and you want to do a 1031 exchange into

a different property, while taking advantage of the tax benefits,

here’s one critical thing you need know 👇

When it comes to 1031 exchanges, there are a lot of rules to follow.

Since there are so many rules, it’s easy to get this wrong.

Without knowing it, many people go through with a disqualified exchange.

The critical thing to keep in mind is the taxpayer needs to be the same person.

So a partnership can perform a 1031 exchange (at the partnership level), as long as the property sold, and the new property acquired, are in the name of the same partnership entity.

But what happens, and this is common in partnerships, if one of the partners doesn’t want to perform a 1031 exchange?

In comes the “drop and swap” or “swap and drop”.

But before we get there, why do you have to do a “drop and swap”?

Can’t I just sell my partnership interest and defer the gain?

No.

1031’s are for real property to real property exchanges.

Partnership interests are not real property.

So, if you want to do a 1031 exchange, but you have a partnership interest, is to DROP the property out of the entity to the individual owners (now a TIC), and then each individual can do their own SWAP (1031 exchange).

Can you do a drop and swap all in the same day?

No, ideally you are holding this property in the TIC for 24 months.

This is to show intent that this property was held for investment.

In short, be careful doing a 1031 exchange.

There are a lot of rules, and ways this can go wrong.

Find a qualified intermediary who understands these rules and can help you navigate the best solution for your partnership.

### CRE Outlook

Last year was a systemic turning point for multifamily investment performance...

2002 TO 2022: EVERYONE WINS

How much is a dollar of apartment income worth? Twenty years ago $1 of NOI was worth $13. Last year, $1 of NOI was worth $22. Cap rates fell from about 7.5% to 4.5% since 2000.

In other words, if you owned apartments twenty years ago and didn't increase NOI at all, you would have seen a 66% increase in your balance sheet value. If you invested in multifamily 5-20 years ago, you probably made a fortune regardless of your ability to increase property performance.

2023 TO ???: WINNERS AND LOSERS

Increasing interest rates ensure that the cap rate compression cycle is done. Going forward, investment performance will likely be defined by market-level supply/demand dynamics and asset-specific qualities.

Metro markets across the U.S. have very different drivers with respect to population growth, household formation, supply growth, and affordability. ...resulting in very very different outlooks for NOI growth.

We generally disaggregate markets into three buckets:

1. Supply overhang: High-growth markets that boomed during and after Covid (Austin, Nashville, Denver, Seattle, etc.) added significant supply to accommodate inflows of residents. Explosive rent growth increasingly informed development pro formas, justifying big development pipelines. Now, in a more normalized environment, the rent growth outlook for these markets has turned dramatically and generally rounds to 0% growth over the next few years.

2. Recovering markets: "24-hour cities" saw relatively slow recoveries (post-Covid) but didn't see significant supply growth. These markets (NYC, LA, CHI, SF) are expected to continue their recovery and are positioned to outperform on a relative basis.

3. "Tweener" markets: Unsurprisingly, markets with a more stable balance between demand and supply growth are expected to perform relatively well. E.g., Atlanta, Dallas, Boston, San Diego.

OUTLOOK

Bad news: Total returns will likely be much more muted (without the tailwind of falling cap rates).

Good news: Experienced investors who (i) are able to differentiate assets, markets, and submarkets AND (ii) can drive NOI growth are positioned to significantly outperform.

Time to focus on skills and earn returns through skills and hard work...

**A response comment**
 disagree that everyone won from 2002 through 2022

There were scores of foreclosures across the US on multi family assets during the GFC. It was an extremely difficult time to own multi family assets and many lost their properties to their lenders. Now the markets bounced back well but not Everyone won or even close to it especially in many non gateway markets.

And Skill in multi family investing is highly over rated. It takes skills to entitle a project or build a project. It takes skills to asset manage a retail project or an Office project. It’s takes basic knowledge to run a Multi Family project or Renovate a Multi Family project. Now it takes hard work because its tedious but there is nothing skillful about it.

It takes me years to get really good at asset managing Office projects. Building tenant rep relationships, negotiating leases, understanding tenant improvements and capital improvements etc.

Took me about 6-12 months to learn how to oversee Multifamily assets well.


### 2022-02 Real Estate Cycle - Selling

And so it Begins...another normal part of any Real Estate cycle

Distressed sales are finally starting to take place

Its taken a bit longer then I expected but the Office bloodletting is finally here and its going to come pretty fast and get really ugly. The amount of keys being handed over in the Office world will make the GFC look like Childs play. The equity loss will be in numbers that will blow people away. The challenge is there is not a lot of equity that wants to chase Office assets right now and literally no Debt options either.

Until there is clarity in the leasing markets pure Office assets will really struggle and I am not sure when that clarity happens. I mean you can make really negative cases for Office right now. My son likes choose your own adventure books and with Office assets it’s like every page goes to “Sorry you fell off a cliff”.

It is a contrarian buy right now though and a 55% discount off the previous price and probably paying 20% of replacement costs also look great on paper.

But buying a DVD manufacturing business right now is also a contrarian play. Not a good play but Contrarian nonetheless. Remember just because its Contrarian does not mean its the right play. There can be logic in following the herd sometimes.

I think the story on Office assets the next 3-5 years will be fascinating to watch and have absolutely no clue how it will play out outside of the losses will be quite large for some existing owners.
