Imagine making $52,000 from an Airbnb?
& not paying a single penny in taxes

Sounds impossible? 


Let me show you how we pulled it off
?? 

Depreciation is the act of slowly deducting the initial expense of an asset against your taxable income. Generally this is over a 27.5 (residential) or 39 (commercial) yr time frame. So each year you can write off 2-3.6% of the purchase price against your income....

Thats an awesome opportunity.

We bought a cabin for $640k. With a building basis of $560k, that's a $20k a year write off against $50k in cashflow on a $640k deal. 

It makes 40% of our cashflow tax free. Very powerful but there is much more to it....

Different parts of the asset can be depreciated on different schedules. We had a cost segregation study done to split up the depreciable lifespan of different parts of the house. The raw land can't be depreciated so that has to be given a value?.

But other items can be depreciated on a quicker timeline. The roof, driveway, fence, walls, doors, flooring, air conditioners, landscaping, etc....

The IRS has a depreciation schedule for each type. Some parts are 5 yrs, others are 15 yrs. So you can depreciate a portion of the asset costs faster. Once you get the study done, you'll get $ amounts assigned to different parts & different schedules to front-load depreciation?

Bonus Depreciation allows you to deduct a certain % of costs in the 1st yr an asset is in service. So now 25%+ of your asset cost can be DEPRECIATED IN THE FIRST YEAR! 

Side note: Raw land can't be depreciated, so a value needs to be assigned to it?.

So back to the $640k cabin we bought. The cost segregation study came back & 35.9% of the asset cost can be depreciated on a 15 yr or faster timeframe. 

35.9% of $640k is $230k. This is 40% deductible the FIRST YEAR...

This Airbnb will produce $50k in free cash flow. So while $50k goes into the bank account, the tax "LOSS" is $92k. 

This is how real estate owners, investors, operators, and developers make millions a year and pay $0 in taxes?.
