[The Grave Dancer](re_cre\the_grave_dancer.pdf)

Sam Zell's influence is evident from the tributes that have poured in. Here are a few of our favorites, along with a 30-year-old "grave dancing" primer in Zell's own words.

Bloomberg: Zell struck iconic real estate deals and built a reputation as 'the Grave Dancer,' a brash investor who bought other people’s failed properties at distressed prices. Following his death this week at the age of 81, a younger generation of real estate titans remembered him as a larger-than-life figure who played a central role in the making of the commercial real estate industry into a corporate powerhouse in the second half of the 20th century.

Barry Sternlicth (CEO, Starwood Capital Group'): What you saw was what you got. He would say, ‘I don’t want any BS,’ and he’d call people out for talking book or not being honest. He didn’t care what anyone thought about him.

Bob Faith (CEO, Greystar): He didn’t want to do anything small. Real estate had been a mom-and-pop industry but he didn’t see it that way. He said, ‘Let’s go create a really professional company that takes advantage of economies of scale to manage property better than mom and pop.’

Willy Walker (CEO, Walker & Dunlop ): He skied like he did deals — all in. Sam had a twinkle in his eye — literally and figuratively. He was exceedingly generous to those he knew and loved. He will be missed dearly.

Collete English Dixon (ED, Marshall Bennett Institute of Real Estate and UBS TPF Board Member): Such a shock as we are convened in Toronto for the ULI Spring Meeting- such a force, pioneer and industry change maker. Condolences to his family, friends and colleagues.

Peter Linneman (Principal, Linneman Associates): His impact on business, especially real estate, is hard to overstate. He was the embodiment of “entrepreneur”. He was the founder of the original real estate private equity fund as well as a leader in taking real estate to Wall Street. A tireless crusader for good governance and transparency with investors, his impact on the industry is ubiquitous. He touched the lives of so many students around the world. Not least in this regard is Wharton’s Zell-Lurie Real Estate Center. His legacy will live on in these students. And his raspy voice, sense of humor and incisive comments will be forever with me. He will be missed by many.

Howard Ecker (Chairman of the Board, XSPACE): I met Sam just about 50 years ago now. At the time I was working at Arthur Rubloff & Company and was asked by the chairman to attend a lunch with Chicago’s new real estate prodigy Sam Zell. Picture this: 6 of us dressed in suits and ties when Sam walks in in a white leisure suit, white patent boots, and gold chains. You can just picture the contrast! Some time during the lunch, Sam passes me a note--"what are you doing with these fu..king stiffs"-- and so our friendship began!

Rod Petrik (REIT Analyst, Stifel Nicolaus): RIP Sam Zell. A f*!ng LEGEND.
