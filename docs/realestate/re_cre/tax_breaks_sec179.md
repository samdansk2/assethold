I bought my wife her dream car—and we legally wrote off nearly the entire cost.

Because the vehicle weighs over 6,000 lbs (GVWR) and is used primarily for business, it qualified under Section 179—allowing us to write off almost the full amount in the year we bought it.

Her business has been around for 7+ years and everything is well-documented, so this is 100% by the book.

I’ve worked with companies from $2M to over $1B in revenue, and over the years, I’ve picked up smart tax strategies that we’ve applied to our own business. The result? We paid just 4% in taxes on our gross income last year—all legally.

No shady loopholes. No offshore tricks. Just understanding what’s already in the tax code.

If you’re running a business and not using:
 • Section 179 for eligible vehicles or equipment
 • The home office deduction
 • Clean, real-time bookkeeping that syncs with your bank 
 • Marketing expenses—from paid ads to website costs
 • Travel tied to client work or conferences
 • Qualified donations
 • And the 20% QBI deduction (available through 2025)…

You might be missing out on some things that could really move the needle.

Curious how this could apply to you?
I’ve got a coffee chat link in my profile. Happy to share what I’ve learned—no pressure, just value.

### Comments

The requirements for Section 179 are a lot higher than bonus depreciation. Proceed at your own risk, but definitely enjoy the new car!

Appreciate everyone who took the time to read this—means a lot. As a business owner, you’re playing a different game than a W-2 employee. The average W-2 worker pays about 22–24% of their income in federal taxes alone. But as a business owner, you have a legal right to lower your tax liability through smart planning. With solid bookkeeping and proactive strategies, you can keep more cash in your business or your pocket. Having an accountant isn’t just a cost—it’s a tool for growth. Feel free to message me or schedule a quick coffee chat if you want to dial in your accounting.

I would not right off 100%. At best 90% or 80% business use. There is always a personal use to it i.e do you go shopping in it for personal items, do you park it at home (commuting). A business vehicle is not used for these purposes. Also you need mileage logs with details of business use. Yes you can take deductions but you have to work for it (strict compliance). Also I would just pay my taxes. Why spend $100,000 to save $20,000 on taxes. I would rather have more money in my bank than "save" on taxes.

George E. L. Great points—you’re absolutely right that compliance is key, and mileage logs are non-negotiable for anyone trying to take full advantage of the deduction. That said, the strategy isn’t about spending $100K just to save $20K—it’s about making a purchase you were already planning and using financing (like any W-2 employee might) to spread it out, while capturing a sizable tax deduction upfront. With the right documentation and a solid accountant, it’s a smart play for business owners who truly use the vehicle for business purposes.

Be careful how you document it. As someone that once wanted to work for the government agency with the best greeting "Hi, I'm from the IRS. I'm here to help you."
This could look like a bonus vs company asset purchase 😁

Travis Abrahamson Great point—and exactly why you need someone in your corner who’s done this before. If you’re not an accountant or haven’t had direct exposure to these kinds of strategies, definitely don’t try to pull it off solo. Documentation, structure, and intent matter big time.

Thanks for sharing Kyle Schulz. I have a couple questions if you have time…

1: doesn’t the amount over $31,300 fall under bonus depreciation and capped at 40%? If so, how did you get to almost 100% in write offs year 1? 

2: if you sell the car two years later for 70% of what you bought it for, would depreciation recapture kick in and function the same way it does for real estate?

Benton Blake Great questions—and happy to share how we approached it since we bought the vehicle in 2024.

We used Section 179 up to the SUV cap (around $28,900) and then applied 60% bonus depreciation on the remaining basis. What’s left after that gets depreciated over time using MACRS. Altogether, it got us close to a full write-off in year one based on business use.

And yes, depreciation recapture would apply if we sell it later—definitely something we’re keeping in mind down the line.

I posted this because now that we’re already halfway through 2025, it’s a great time for business owners to start thinking ahead—especially when it comes to large purchases like vehicles. Waiting until year-end often limits your options.

Appreciate the questions —these conversations help all of us get sharper ⚔️

Kyle Schulz I'm all for paying as little taxes as possible and you mentioned some great deductions. In fact, if the whole goal was just to buy your wife her dream car (and you can afford it) then that's reason enough to buy it so enjoy!

However, I think a key question is how much in taxes did the purchase actually save you on your marginal rate? The 4% taxes on gross income doesn't give much useful information. We are taxed one net income, not gross income.

Once again, congrats on the new ride!

Michael Espinosa, CFP® Appreciate the thoughtful perspective, Michael. I agree—being profitable and then applying the right deductions is the sweet spot.

Something else I’ve seen in my career is that not all tax strategy is about minimizing taxes through losses—sometimes, certain assets like rental properties or acquisitions with negative P&Ls but positive cash flow can create long-term value and act as a tax shield when structured properly.

In our case, we focused on building a profitable business and then applied deductions that aligned naturally with our operations—business-use assets, marketing tied to growth, and properly documented expenses. It wasn’t about finding a workaround, just being intentional and disciplined with what’s available in the code.

Really appreciate discussions like this—sharing real strategies and experiences helps all of us get sharper.

Zach Dubin Technically, I bought it—but we titled it in both of our names since she’s a sole proprietor (Schedule C) and we file taxes jointly. Because the vehicle is primarily used for her business and the ownership aligns, her business can still write it off through deductions like Section 179 or bonus depreciation—as long as we document business use properly. With sole proprietors, the business and individual are one and the same in the IRS’s eyes, so structure and intent matter.
