In 2020 I retired my wife and doubled her income

Which allowed me to get a $30,000 tax return in doing so.

And become an instant hero in my family.

How? 

Well we bought an Airbnb 

And she managed the listing for us. 

Allowing her to make 2X as much as she made as an elementary school teacher

While only working an hour/day. 

And because of Reg. Section 1.469-1T (e)(3)(ii)(a) of the IRS tax code

She was now considered a real estate professional. 

Which means all of the depreciation from the property could be used to offset the taxable income from my W2 job. 

So now my wife is a stay at home mom 

Working 1hr/day making 2x what she made before

And we pay zero taxes. 

Because we have over $130,000 in tax deductions from our rental properties. 

We call this the Vacation Rental Millionaire Method

Shoot me a message with the word “VRMM”

And I’ll send you the book if you want to learn more.

Ashton IRS requires that a REP work atleast 750 hrs a year on RE activities to claim that status. An hour a day is at most 365 hrs well below 750 hrs threshold. Atleast wouldn’t say 1 hr a day in an open forum
