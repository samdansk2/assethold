### 2022 Rates

Rate strategies that Atlas is using across various indexes, and some counter intuitive year end thinking from lenders - Let me explain:

Prime is up at 7% and likely to climb again Dec. 13. SOFR is up and continues to rise.

However, Treasury rates are holding down by 40ps.

We are working with lenders who use US Treasuries as their index. We are also working with Prime based lenders who are actually able to lock rates below Prime when they hadn’t done so before it rose so much. Not all lenders can, but we spend time specifically researching who can do so.

SOFR based loans are still happening but may be toughest because they must add a spread on top of SOFR and are usually floating rate. Silver lining here: Atlas has researched and cultivated lenders relationships with previously only variable rate SOFR lenders, who are now offering fixed options.

We are in a better rate environment now than we have been for months as lenders are trying to find ways to keep rates reasonable, they are tired of not lending. Several top national lenders have told me they need to fill their annual debt target by year end.

Which means we can still get deals closed by year end and at a more reasonable rate than even a month ago.

In 2023 some lenders may actually get less creative with their financing because they know most investors are waiting until the new year and expect a January floodgate to open in new loan opportunities, and they haven’t even met their 2022 goals yet. Supply / demand timing of loan requests is something to consider.

Let me know what you’re working on, I will try to be of help. Let’s see what rate options we have for you before January. Some lenders are even doing a free rate lock as an incentive. I’m not talking agency here, those locks are never free, but other local types of lenders have done so for me.

Also I don’t take holidays if deals are hot, let’s go. Always working.

## Scenario 1

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/barrett-linburg-32070310_heres-a-scenario-that-i-heard-recently-from-activity-7000499960114814976-ep2V

Here's a scenario that I heard recently from a mortgage broker:
▪️ 1980's MF property bought late 2021
▪️ $50mm purchase & improvements
▪️ Trending to $2.5mm NOI (5% cap)
▪️ Loan $37mm with rate cap for 1 more year

Sponsor Options:
#1 Extend Rate Cap another year ($750k)
#2 Cash-in Refi for $33mm & add pref or common equity
#3 Sell for $44mm(ish)

Lots of market participants have varied opinions on how this plays out.

With the rate cap extension, the sponsor may end up being in a worse position 12 months from now.

With a "cash-in" refi, the common equity investors may have alligator arms even if funding may be in their best interest. Eastdil Secured CEO recently noted that people are raising pref equity to fund buying out-year caps and we expect a lot more of that in the next 18-24mo...but the terms/covenants of that equity may be tough for many sponsors to stomach.

Some sponsors will simply choose to rip off the band-aid now and sell, living to fight another day. This may prove to be the wisest choice for all parties involved despite a loss to the LP's.

The bottom line as I see it, many GP’s will be facing a version of this dilemma and some will asset manage well while also financially managing creatively & prudently. All the while over communicating with LP’s and demonstrating integrity

Others will do none of those things

- Comment 1: Yup, absolutely seeing and hearing of similar situations. Another factor that I didn't see in your scenario is the maturity date on the loan. Other key dates would be when cash management or resizing tests kick in. Lots of variables for GPs to evaluate.

## Case Study 2

https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6999104211086970880/

Same deal…different returns. Profit of $11.9mm using the OZ structure but only $6.2mm in a normal structure.
 
The financial benefit of investing in the Opportunity Zone tax structure is graphically outlined below (using a Savoy already closed deal).
 
It has taken us a long time to dial in our model to distill each OZ benefit to a dollar amount.
 
Let's assume our average investor (30% tax bracket) had a $5.5mm long term capital gain and wanted to put it all into this sample project as an LP.
 
First, the deferral. The OZ structure offers a deferral on the initial capital gain. This deferral allows the investor to put the full $5.5mm LP investment into the new project in the OZ structure. In a normal scenario, the investor would have to pay 23.4% in taxes and then only be able to invest $4.21mm into the project. The OZ investor still owes the $1.3mm in taxes but not until April of 2027 and the additional % ownership in the new investment is worth A LOT.
 
Second, let's discuss depreciation. In a normal Real Estate project, depreciation is like an interest free loan from government which
eventually must be recaptured. In the OZ structure, it acts much more like a tax credit. The losses created from depreciation during the hold period never need to be recaptured. Savoy works with cost segregation engineers and CPAs to maximize the value that can be created using bonus depreciation.
 
Finally, if held for 10+ years this project should be sold for more than it cost to build. We only want to do deals that make sense
from a real estate perspective. In the OZ structure, this long term gain will not be taxable. In a normal structure, a large tax liability will exist, we modeled 23.4% but in reality this rate could be lower or higher in 2033.

**2023-05 Multifamily Financing Options**

Multifamily Financing: Locking long term interest rates when rates are high. Does it ever make sense? Are there loans that allow you to capitalize if/when rates come down in the future?
The answer is YES!

With HUD financing, we have the ability to lower your interest rate if rates come down in the future. We can do this a few different ways, including a simple Interest Rate Reduction, which is a super simple process without increasing your loan amount, and no costs/fees other than legal and title update.

HUD loans are also a declining prepay structure as opposed to yield maintenance or defeasance, and, we have the ability to customize the declining prepay structure to work with your business plans. For example, if you're anticipating a capital event to take place in year 4, we can structure the prepay for that benefit for there to be minimal or even no prepay at that time.

Not to forget, we underwrite to 1.176x DSCR on a 35 year amortization (and a 35 year term, fixed) at an 85% LTV. For affordable properties, we can go as low as a 1.11x DSCR and 90% LTV. Rates today are the in low 5%'s, non-recourse, fixed.

Please reach out if you'd like my team and I to size a loan for you.
