**2023-04 The Dilemma With Development:**

As I always say, the metric that we focus on most for pretty much any deal is the yield on cost at #stabilization (stabilized NOI/total cost).

Of course, this is after we test rent and expense assumptions to make sure they are within #reason... (Your YOC could easily be #skewed by assuming unreasonable rents or light expenses)

Here's the difficulty I'm having with #developments currently.

The development deals I'm getting sent (in MF) are stabilizing to a 6.5% - 7% trended YOC. (Trending YOC means you assume #market rent growth throughout the development period.)

At the same time, I have sponsors buying BRAND NEW #Multifamily at a 5% cap, and after reducing concessions, and burning loss to lease (which is typically higher in 1st generation leases), the sponsors are still getting to a...

6.5% YOC...

Same YOC by year 3, but one one #deal you have no construction risk, and get to cashflow the deal for a couple of years...

The other deal has #construction risk and now cashflow until built.

I'm curious to see how my developer contacts are navigating this. Is my data skewed? Are my assumptions here off?

## Class A costing

How Much Does it Cost to Build a 300-unit, Class-A, Garden-Style Apartment Community?

The Answer?

It Depends.

Although this is the most infuriating answer, that's just how it is.

The cost to build anything depends on
👉 the site
👉 the municipality
👉 the availability of labor
👉 the appetite of capital partners
👉 the developer's relationships
👉 the strike price of land
👉 the developer's ability to execute

Please review our company's public financial statements for details, but most builders in Central Florida have a hard time building garden-style apartments for less than $250K/unit (all-in).

Assuming a 7% YOC and 60% operating efficiency, rents would need to be $2,431/unit to justify new product. In our best submarkets, rents are pushing $2,200/unit, which has pushed many builders out of the market for now until rents rise or costs come down.

Look to mid/high-rise product in coastal markets for higher rents but building costs there are different animals.

Costs are comprised of four major components:

👉 Land (lagging indicator, takes a few years to work out)
👉 Labor (leading indicator, cost based on workload for the next 12-18 months)
👉 Materials (concurrent indicator, cost changes based on supply chain)
👉 Capital (concurrent indicator -- I would love someone active in the lending/equity/capital raising space to chime in here on how Capital costs change with market conditions)

Rents are determined on two major factors:

👉 Availability of supply vs demand
👉 Distribution of Household Income

As income (rents) change with construction costs, developer appetite also shifts. For new entrants and incumbents, it's important to measure and track these metrics, which can be broadly understood by builder sentiment, new housing starts, and new housing permits as shown below.


### Cost Breakdown


How to Construct a Development Budget

A development budget is comprised of three major sections:

👉 Land price and closing costs (?)
👉 Hard costs ($175K - $225K/unit)
👉 Soft costs ($35K - $65K/unit)

Let's dive in.

LAND PRICE & CLOSING COSTS

While typically the top of the budget as it's often what all eyes are on, this is actually the last item to be filled out in a development budget.

The land price is the residual value a developer can pay after factoring in all of their costs and projected profits.

I'm intentionally leaving the residual value blank for two reasons:

👉I'm not telling you what we pay for land... 😏

👉More importantly, every developer's intent for the land, hold period, actual construction costs, execution strategy, return thresholds, etc. is slightly and sometimes vastly different, causing incongruent fluctuations in land value.

Whoever pays the most and closes the fastest wins. Just be careful of making that your company motto on the buy-side.

HARD COSTS

Included in hard costs are the following and generally run between $175K - $225K/unit.

👉General Conditions (payroll, equipment rentals, insurance. the cost of labor during sitework and delivering finished buildings)

👉Sitework and offsites (site prep and clearing, running utilities, hardscape and landscape work. The cost to prepare the site for building the structures)

👉Vertical Costs (concrete, lumber, metals, furnishing and finishes. The cost to deliver a finished building)

👉General Contractor Fee

👉Hard Cost Contingency

SOFT COSTS

Included in soft costs are the following and generally run between $35K - $65K/unit

👉 Legal & Consultants
👉 Site Surveys & Plans
👉 Architectural & Engineering
👉 Signage, FF&E, General Marketing Materials
👉 Pre-Leasing Operations
👉 Municipal Fees
👉 Environmental/Community Impact Mitigation Fees
👉 Imputed Financing Costs and Operating Deficit Reserves
👉 Soft Cost Contingency

Building apartment communities takes a lot of work and many hands to deliver a finished product. From the time a site is identified to the time the final product is delivered, leased, and sold can be as quick as 3 years but some projects run for 7-10+ years.

Developers are people that love new challenges every day, take their projects personally, and want to make a lasting impact in their communities. If that sounds like fun to you, I'm always happy to have discussions on or offline.

### 2024 potential loan issues


https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johndrachman_mf1-2022-fl9probably-means-nothing-to-activity-7102101760688721920-aT9j?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop

MF1 2022-FL9....Probably means nothing to the Average real estate professional. But this is where a lot of the pain will be in Multi-Family assets this cycle.

For background MF1 2022-FL9 is a Collateralized Loan Obligation made of a package of $1.8B of loans originally lent to Value Add Multi-Family Operators in 2021/2022. These loans were 24-36 months in length and all are floating rate debt products at high LTV's meant to take advantage of rising rents and stable interest rates. Multi-Family real estate only goes up right...

Oopsies

Effectively this was a pool of Subprime mortgages where the hope was the party of buying Multi-Family units, putting lipstick on a pig, jacking rents, and then selling them for increased values would continue forever.

Well that party is over and the Hangover hurts. How bad is the Hangover in this loan pool you might ask?

Really painful right now...like you wish you did not have that 12th Red Bull Vodka at 3am 

Out of the 39 loans in the Pool, only 10 are NOT on Watch Lists right now which is the first step to pain. Yes 29 out of the 39 loans are on Watch Lists right now. 5 of the Loans have currently not made their mortgage payments in August. The implied Yield on Cost right now based on acquisition price and current NOI is 3.31%...and the current DSCR average is 0.77. That means overall for every dollar of a Loan Payment there is only $0.77 of NOI to cover it so reserves must be used to cover them. 

So what happens to this pool...people who invested in it will lose money as borrowers can not pay off these loans when they come due. The people at the top of the Loan stacks (that's who takes on the greatest risk) will lose the most.

If you want to know where there pain will come from, its places like MF1 2022-FL9. My sense is the smart brokers are already calling the Special Servicers of these Loan pools to make the connections now. If I was a Multi-Family broker it would be what I would be doing.

As Wayne Gretzky once said, "I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been".
