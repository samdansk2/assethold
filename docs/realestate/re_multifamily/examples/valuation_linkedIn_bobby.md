Reality still hasn’t sunk in for many, but multifamily prices are down 15-20% (20-40% down in some markets). Going forward, this is going to present some pain for existing investments but is a much-needed reset going forward so we at Vanamor are much more excited about 2023 than we were 2021. We're likely in the bottoming process now but it will be a 6 to 18 month process as discretionary sellers become forced sellers.

3-Step Back of a Napkin Underwrite
Below is an example of quick math underwriting as well as an example of where many aggressive purchase over the past two years are today. Identifiable information has been removed to not highlight a specific property but this is one of many examples I reviewed throughout the sunbelt recently. Even if you focus solely on LP investments, below is a very quick way of analyzing an investment opportunity. This isn't an extensive underwrite but rather "napkin math" to ballpark pricing.

Inputs
Current Asking Rents: $993 and declining
Occupancy: 91.2% and declining
Units: 216

Assumptions
Expense Ratio: 35%; depends on the market, property vintage, and property size but will typically be between 35% to 55%.
Cap Rate: 5% assumed cap rate today. 2021 cap rates were likely 3 to 3.5%. Counter-argument is that some aggressive buyers are still transacting at 4.5% cap rates today.
Expected PF Rent: $993 x 5% discount = $943.35. Given both declining rents and declining occupancy, it's safe to assume today's asking rents are too high. You can be aggressive and assume $993 as starting rents or provide a discount based on rent trajectory and occupancy.

Quick Math
Step 1: $943.35 (Expected PF Rent) x 216 (units) x 12 = $2,445,163 (Rental Income)
Step 2: $2,445,163 (Rental Income) x 65% (1 minus Expense Ratio) = $1,589,356 (NOI)
Step 3: $1,589,356 (NOI) ÷ 5% (Cap Rate) = $31,787,121 (Today’s Value)

Result
With quick 30 second math, we estimate today's value for this property is $31.8m.

$31.8 million is a 36% discount to its early 2022 purchase price and more significant, the value is lower than the high leverage loan used to acquire the property. Meaning, forced sellers are coming and likely going to be a significant story in 2023 and 2024.
