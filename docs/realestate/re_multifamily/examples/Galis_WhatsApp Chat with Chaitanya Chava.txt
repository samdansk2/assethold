2/13/21, 5:01 PM - Vamsi Galigutta: Thanks for sharing that crowdfunding site. Looks very informative. Will be spending more time on it
2/14/21, 7:29 PM - Chaitanya Chava: I don't like this offering. Red flags:
1) They have 2 person asset management team, each of them with a meager 1300 units of management experience. They can't bring much value to this. I recognize them by face but they hid last names (?), so can't recollect where I met them. 
2) This is an institutional-grade asset. I expect reputed national property management firms (Pinnacle, Lincoln etc.,) to do property management and use their marketing to bring high-quality renters. Only reason not to do that is that sponsors want a slice of property management/asset management revenue pie.
3) Given the institutional investment grade, only reason little guys get to buy this by overpaying.
4) They have no credible plan to justify rent growth over 4 years (inflation?). They expect rents to grow a lot while operational expenses decrease by 30% over the same time. This delta is possible in badly run class-C properties but not class A.

Anycase they are betting that general macroeconomic trends (low-interest rates, decrease in-home ownership) will lift them along with all the boats and guys like this have been right last 10-years by a big margin. That is the only reason to invest if you want to.
2/14/21, 8:11 PM - Vamsi Galigutta: Thanks  Chava, some very good points.

One item I am personally worried about is how levered these investments are to really low rates. If they go up by a couple of points, not only does the finance cost shoot up, but the multiple anyone will pay on equity will compress. Will be a double whammy.

Like you said last few years was the other way and this is a continued bet on lower rates.

Very insightful point on asset management.  My understanding is the asset management is entirely in house. The 2 people on the brochure are on the payroll of the sponsor's LLC I believe. Looks like this is not the norm. I remember them alluding to this as a potential driver of ops cost reduction.

When it's time to sell the property do you think this arrangement will be a potential liability?
2/14/21, 8:15 PM - Vamsi Galigutta: They are also confident of marketing the property themselves thru referral programs and save money there. Not sure of the cost benefit there.
2/14/21, 8:21 PM - Vamsi Galigutta: The only other upside I am seeing regarding Dallas is that it's perhaps the hottest housing market.  And the declining affordability will likely give these kind of guys, perhaps better pricing power.

I was offered a similar deal in florida, that didn't make sense in a similar way that I declined.
2/14/21, 8:33 PM - Vamsi Galigutta: Also really mindful of your point that these A properties can be easily replicated unlike class C or B properties. So rent increases are perhaps capped.

Just thinking out loud as this is the first time diving deep into this
2/14/21, 8:36 PM - Chaitanya Chava: Interest rates are fixed for 10-years with lot of prepayment penalty. So, increase in interest may be good for operations ( if inflation drives it). However it isn't good for sale price and conversational wisdom is high interest rates are bad for multifamily in general.
2/14/21, 8:37 PM - Chaitanya Chava: I am not worried about conflict of interest affecting sale
2/14/21, 8:37 PM - Vamsi Galigutta: These guys are financing using 3+1+1 loans
2/14/21, 8:38 PM - Chaitanya Chava: Ok..so not a regular fannie/freddie loan?
2/14/21, 8:38 PM - Vamsi Galigutta: Not sure that's standard terminology. but these are certainly shorter term than normal then
2/14/21, 8:39 PM - Vamsi Galigutta: Certainly not. Private lenders like berkadia etc.
2/14/21, 8:39 PM - Chaitanya Chava: I have 4.2Mil loan with Berkedia. 7 year fixed
2/14/21, 8:40 PM - Chaitanya Chava: Berkedia and lenders like that aren't that deligent about doing checks on sponsors. They only care about property
2/14/21, 8:40 PM - Vamsi Galigutta: Ok. Similar I guess then. I see these loans come into our bank balance sheets.
2/14/21, 8:41 PM - Chaitanya Chava: Also they are ruthless. Cancelled one loan last minute as CoVId was tamping up
2/14/21, 8:42 PM - Chaitanya Chava: I like fannie/freddie and they don't give loans with out good sponsor resume, and are helpful in bad times like CoVId with payment deferral etc.,
2/14/21, 8:42 PM - Vamsi Galigutta: Definitely. Familiar with the GSE programs a bit
2/14/21, 8:42 PM - Chaitanya Chava: Greystone and operators that service fannie/freddie are also hands on with operational details, insurance etc
2/14/21, 8:43 PM - Chaitanya Chava: Berkerdia doesn't care if you pay them monthly dues. You can go buy riskiest insurance out there
2/14/21, 8:44 PM - Chaitanya Chava: So, overall another pillar of support for due diligence is gone of this isn't conventional multifamily loan
2/14/21, 8:44 PM - Vamsi Galigutta: Agreed
2/14/21, 8:45 PM - Vamsi Galigutta: So when folks like nithya do this on a larger scale, do that default to fannie freddie loans?
2/14/21, 8:45 PM - Chaitanya Chava: Dallas is a great market but high completion partly because of high concentration of syndicators here
2/14/21, 8:47 PM - Chaitanya Chava: Nithya etc are preferred borrowers and might even get better rates. They also can access overseas money by essentially offering their own mortgage backed securities. Bigger they get, it's all financing innovation
2/14/21, 8:48 PM - Chaitanya Chava: Nithya CEO said they have 500M of saudi money and are refinancing portfolios
2/14/21, 8:48 PM - Vamsi Galigutta: Yep.. that makes sense. so these smaller folks have to go shorter term etc., to compete
2/14/21, 8:49 PM - Vamsi Galigutta: Wow. That's certainly interesting.
2/14/21, 8:49 PM - Chaitanya Chava: I prefer to Atlanta to Dallas as syndicators are just getting there after saturating Dallas
2/14/21, 8:50 PM - Vamsi Galigutta: Got it. Yes atlanta is doing really well too. Any thoughts on austin?
2/14/21, 8:51 PM - Chaitanya Chava: Austin isn't seen great for multifamily folks (basically class C folks I am familiar with).
2/14/21, 8:51 PM - Vamsi Galigutta: Ok..
2/14/21, 8:52 PM - Chaitanya Chava: Real deals are found in small 40-70 unit properties that are difficult to syndicate and even manage
2/14/21, 8:52 PM - Chaitanya Chava: But these are only if you want to do it active not passive.
2/14/21, 8:53 PM - Vamsi Galigutta: Yep, huge appetite for larger assets for sure
2/14/21, 8:53 PM - Chaitanya Chava: I wanted to build a startup aggregating these based on technology based insights/management but that is too big of a task for first startup..may be someday
2/14/21, 8:53 PM - Chaitanya Chava: If my other startup succeeds and I cash out
2/14/21, 8:54 PM - Vamsi Galigutta: Please let me know if you ever get into that!!
2/14/21, 8:54 PM - Chaitanya Chava: Sure.
2/14/21, 8:55 PM - Vamsi Galigutta: It was a great conversation and very insightful. I will be backing away from this deal for now and stay relatively liquid for the time being.

Thanks a ton for your insight and perspective!
2/14/21, 8:58 PM - Vamsi Galigutta: Also please drop a line of your ever happen to be in the DC area and have free time. Will come down to meet!
2/14/21, 8:59 PM - Chaitanya Chava: Certainly, same here. Let's meet if you are in Dallas
2/14/21, 8:59 PM - Vamsi Galigutta: Sure thing! Will let you know.
