The multifamily construction pipeline is making headlines recently so lets dig into the numbers. But first, let's address two common misconceptions.

1) New construction doesn't matter for rent growth because the severe shortage of housing the past 10 years.

We have had a severe housing shortage the past 10+ years. That is an absolute fact but because of that shortage, rents and prices are where they are today. Rent growth is forward looking so you need to ignore the lack of housing deliveries in the past and focus on future deliveries relative to population growth and the removal of existing housing stock.

2) The construction pipeline has a significant impact on rents and prices.

Would love to see an actual study with a regression analysis on this, but from Vanamor research has shown a relatively low correlation (current and lagged) between new supply and rental rates/prices. Sometimes new construction amplifies a population boom because it expands the workforce which then requires additional housing. Now there can also be a danger of overconcentration because construction jobs tend to be very cyclical, as was seen in Phoenix following the Great Financial Crisis.

Now to the numbers. Based on Yardi Matrix, the number of units expected to be completed nationally over the next three years is 2.8%. Not a very large number to begin with and after accounting for a 1.25% to 1.75% decay (removal of existing units most often due to age), it translates into an overall annual increase of multifamily units of 1.55% to 1.05%. Household formation is expected to be weak at ~0.62% so that leave 0.93% to 0.43% excess supply growth. This will be a headwind but not as significant as headlines make it seem.

Across submarkets, the numbers range wildly from 0.8% to 8.6% (breakdown attached on Yardi's top 100 markets). Each have their own population trends and age of existing inventory so it requires a deeper dive. However, it's safe to say that the top 15 markets which average a 6.18% annual increase over the next 3 years will face significantly stronger headwinds.

New construction is just one piece of the puzzle and should not make a full investment thesis.
