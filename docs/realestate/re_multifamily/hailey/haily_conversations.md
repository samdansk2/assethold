### 2022-06 Conversation

Key notes:
- In Texas primary markets (Dallas, Austin, Houston) in 2022-Q1, 1980s, 1990s properties are going at 3%, 2% and at times 1.5% cap rates. Hailey was involved in ~42 deals.
- In 2022-Q2, the sales have stalled with the increased interest rate increase. The assets are waiting on the sidelines.
- In secondary and teritiary markets such as Beaumont, Freeport etc., there may be properties available at 5% cap rates.   
- Underwriting is always evaluated with proforma (includes anticipations of cost reduction, rent increases, etc. i.e. not actuals)
- New people are not welcome. They are shunned upon as they may not close the deals (or unable to raise funds) in a timely manner or back-out.
