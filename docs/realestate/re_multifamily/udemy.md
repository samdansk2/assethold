### The Underwriting Process

- Identify Subject Property

        - updated tenant rent roll / trailing 12 month income statement
    - Sale assumption
    -  Perform analysis
- Tour 
    - Property current state
- Market research and refined underwriting
    - Debt Quotes
    - Updated market rents
    - updated tenant rent roll / trailing 12 month income statement
    - Unit renovations
    - Common area upgrades
    - Debt seeking for the financial model for closing

## Metrics
### Investment Metrics

High Level Purchase Metrics:
- Purchase Price
- Captial Rate (Cap Rate or Cap)
- Net Operation Income (NOI) = Purchase Price * Capital Rate(%) /100


- Cash on Cash Return = Annual Net Cashflow / Total Equity Cash Contribution
- Annual Net Cashflow should be net of:
    - Refinance
    - Sale proceeds

- IRR (Internal Rate of return): The discount rate at which the net present value of all cashflows is zero
- XIRR is based on time value of money on daily basis. Most accurate
- Equity Multiple : Good metric to cross verify when the IRR is showing high. This scenario happens for low time line investments (i.e. fix & flip)

### Loan Metrics

Measures the chance of getting loand for properties

- LTV (Loan to Value)
    - Target for lenders is ~60% to 75%
    - Preferred range (60% to 75%)
- LTC (Loan to Cost)
    - Includes the closing costs and renovation costs
    - Marginally lower than LTV
- DSCR: 
    - Debt Service Coverage Ratio
    - NOI/Total Debt Service
    - A measure of risk (higher the better)
    - Preferred range (1.1x to 1.5x)
- Debt Yield 
    - NOI/Loan Amount (higher number is better)
    - A measure of risk in the event of foreclosure
    - Preferred range (1.1x to 1.5x)
