## How to Invest in Real Estate w/o Paying a Penny of Tax: Part 1 Why IRAs + 401k's don't cut it

You can pay $0 in tax. IRA's/Solo 401k's are okay but won't get you the whole way there, due to limited tax sheltering and/or significant limitations.

## Strategy 01

Real Estate Investors and Business Owners:

Depreciation recapture can blindside you.

Here's one (of many) ways to plan around it 👇

1031 Exchange

This method can work for business equipment but is most commonly used for real estate investments.

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐭 𝐢𝐬: A strategy to defer the gain on the sale of an asset.

𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐢𝐭 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐬:

If you sell an asset you can send the sale proceeds to a "qualified intermediary". You then have 45 days to identify replacement properties and 180 total days to close on one of them.

Any capital gain you have accrued gets rolled over to the next property, reducing your tax basis.

Watch out for taxable boot and the limitations above.

𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐢𝐭'𝐬 𝐠𝐨𝐨𝐝:

Unlimited and indefinite gain deferral.

A step-up in basis to your heirs when you die.

(both of these are HUGE tax benefits.)

Stack that against any qualified plan and tell me which is better. 🤷‍♂️

𝐀𝐧 𝐞𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞:

You bought a commercial property for $1M with 20% down 10 years ago. You haven't refinanced it, and you now owe $670,000. (6% interest, 30-year fixed)

Today, the property is worth $1,790,000 (6% annual appreciation).

Net of 9% closing costs ($161,100) and the $670,000 loan balance, you'll have ~$960,000 of investable cash when you sell.

💥The tax you will pay if you sell it will be ~$270,500. (I can put the breakdown in the comments.)

After tax, you're left with ~$689,500 to spend however you'd like.

💡If you 1031 exchange it, you can afford a downpayment on a $4,000,000 property. (That covers 20% down and 3% closing costs).

You pay no tax, you receive no money, but now you have a $4M asset that should cash flow at least twice as much as the original asset.

𝐒𝐨 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞'𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:


Great questions! There are four options in my book:
1. Pay the tax now.
2. 1031 exchange.
3. Sell, but buy a replacement property that you can take bonus depreciation on and wipe away the gain completely.
4. Never sell, or if you do, do another 1031 exchange. Never pay tax until you die. Your heirs get a step-up in basis and they pay less tax when they sell.

Should you exchange or not exchange and choose another option?


Put your comments below!

((By the way, you can still do another cost seg on the new property!))

- Very insightful. Could you breakdown the taxes of $270500 please?
    - Syriac George M., here's the breakdown:
    $200,000 recapture taxed at ordinary rates for the bonus depreciation we took. (200,000 * 37% = 74,000)
    $153,000 of regular depreciation taken, recaptured at preferential rates. (153,000 * 25% = $38,500)
    $790,000 capital gain taxed at capital gains rates (790,000 * 20% = 158,000)
    74,000 + 38,500 + 158,000 = $270,500.
    This is assuming you are in the highest marginal brackets and doesn't include the additional 3.8% NIIT tax that would be included if your investment was passive.
    NIIT would be 790,000 * 3.8% = $30,020, pushing your total tax to over $300,000.

- Exchange if you want to continue managing properties… CRT if you want income and impact but less stress/ hassle in real estate
    - Charitable remainder trusts are irrevocable trusts that let you donate assets to charity and draw annual income for life or for a specific time period. The assets are owned by the trust so no capital gains taxes and the entire amount can be used to produce income through a defined benefit annuity CRAT or invested assets with a defined withdrawal rate CRUT
    - Exchanging into a Delaware Statutory Trust is another great planning tool for exchangers look for less management and work!
- 1031 exchange is one of the most useful pieces of the tax code. No brainer to do it. Cash flow is king💡
- Never pay taxes, legally of course. This is what the pros do! There are very few ways to do this outside of real estate. It's nearly impossible unless you know what you're doing as a real estate professional!


## Strategy 02

Inflation is ripping you off.

Taxes are going up.

And I love it. Why?

𝐈 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐨 𝐟𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐤.

You don't need to pay more tax by default. (Even though that's how the tax code is written.

𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞'𝐬 𝐨𝐧𝐞 𝐭𝐚𝐱 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭'𝐬 𝐠𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐮𝐩 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐬𝐢𝐱 𝐰𝐚𝐲𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐚𝐯𝐨𝐢𝐝 𝐢𝐭.

Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)

NIIT is a 3.8% tax on investment income if your income is over $250,000 (married filing joint) or $200,000 (single).

This is not indexed for inflation, and are the same thresholds as in 2013!

As inflation compounds, more and more of your income is going to be subject to this tax.

𝐒𝐨, 𝐡𝐨𝐰 𝐝𝐨 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐚𝐯𝐨𝐢𝐝 𝐢𝐭?

1. Reallocate your investments. Only investment income is subject to this tax. Investment income includes:
- Taxable Interest
- Ordinary Dividends
- Capital Gains
- Passive income

You could avoid the tax altogether by investing in growth stocks that don't pay dividends.

2. Invest in real estate passively. Real estate income is usually considered passive income, but depreciation usually creates a taxable loss. You could have positive cash flow but not owe NIIT tax because real estate is generating a loss.

3. Never sell your investments. If you invest in an index fund, you could choose to never sell your investments. Instead, you could borrow against them. (I probably wouldn't do this every year, but you could get creative here with timing.)

4. Investment interest expense. If you itemize you can deduct your investment interest expense against your investment income. Borrow against your assets to invest, and you can use it as a tax deduction. It's not only an itemized deduction, but can reduce the NIIT you pay.

5. Become a qualifying real estate professional (REPS). REPS lets you treat all of your rental activity as active instead of passive. Being a real estate professional can help you avoid this tax altogether.

6. If you're selling your business, make sure you are actively involved in the business in the year of the sale. If you're an active participant, you avoid this tax!

Obviously, you might not be able to do all these every year, or sometimes it's worth it to just pay the tax, instead.

But, more and more people are subject to this tax every year, so it helps to have a strategy to plan around it.

Have you ever paid NIIT?

Talk to a tax professional if you think you might be subject to it this coming year!

### 2 MM/year RE Earnings Without Taxes

We have a client who is a real estate professional.

He makes over $2 million per year from his business, but he hasn't paid income taxes in years. (Legally!)

👇Here's what he does 👇

1. He qualifies as a real estate professional.
2. He invests his business income into new real estate projects.
3. He hires a professional to do a cost segregation study
4. He rinses and repeats, every year.

In essence, he owns two businesses. The first generates revenue, and the second generates tax savings and tax-free income.

Here's an example of how the numbers might break down 👇

He buys a multifamily property for $8 million with a $2 million downpayment from his podcast.

He gets a cost segregation study done. The cost segregation study allows him to deduct about 20% of the $8 million purchase price in the first year, or $1.6 million.

This doesn't quite get him over the edge when it comes to paying no income tax (but keep in mind, he is paying a lot in property tax.)

So, he decides to do a 1031 exchange for two new buildings.

A 1031 exchange lets him sell one project and roll his taxable gain over into the next project(s). He pays no tax when he sells, and the gain is deferred until he sells the new properties.

He decides to do a cost segregation study on one of the new properties.

This reduces his taxable income to zero, so he doesn't do a cost segregation on the second of the two.

He can still do a cost segregation study on the second property in a future tax year. He saves this in his back pocket in case he needs it.

He can rinse and repeat this again and again, forever! The biggest hurdle for him will be finding enough new deals to keep it going.

As long as he can keep the business going, he will likely never pay income taxes again.

At this point, his next goal is to reduce his estate tax so that he can pass more on to his heirs.

His heirs will get a stepped-up basis in the properties and can continue the cycle, compounding their wealth year over year, income-tax-free.

It's completely legal.
