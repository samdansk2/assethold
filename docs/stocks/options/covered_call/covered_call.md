### Sharp Rise in Stock Price or Expect the Stock to go down

If a stock rises sharply and is expected to go down from there based on short-term momentum, 
- a covered call can be a good strategy. 
- investor can sell a call option at a strike price above the current stock price, capturing some of the upside while still holding the stock. 
- If the stock does not rise above the strike price, the investor keeps the premium from selling the call option.
