## Sustainable Investments

### What is a sustainable investment?

Sustainable investments are investments made in assets (real estate, companies, funds etc.) that aim to generate positive financial return for long-time horizon.

Simple rules recommended to invest in a sustainable manner are:

- Reducing debt will create more funds for future investments
 - For a loan with interest rate of x% per year, the cost of capital is (1-tax_rate)x% per year.
   - Assuming a tax rate of 20%, The cost of capital for an interest rate of 6% is 4.8% per year.
 - Any investment may need to be worth more than (1-tax_rate)x%. A factor of  2x (factor is personal reference) of an investment. 
   - For the loan above, it should be worth 9.6% per year. 
   - Taking taxes into account this will be 7.68% per year.

- Cash for investment
  - Dollar cost average
    - Identify the capital for a period to be invested.
    - Always divide this periodic investment capital into 3 or 4 parts and invest them in different time periods.
    - This will reduce the risk of investing all the capital at a high price.
    - This will also reduce the risk of keeping all the capital at a low price.
